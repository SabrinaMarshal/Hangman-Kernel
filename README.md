# Hangman-Kernel
Building a kernel from scratch provides a deep understanding of how a kernel is written. Compiling the kernel yourself allows you to only include the parts relevant to your computer, which makes it smaller and potentially faster, especially at boot time. <br />
Steps-<br />
1. Make a boot file <br />
2. Create the kernel code <br />
3. Create a linker <br />
4. Create a configuration file <br />
5. Build a bootable ISO image <br />
6. Boot the kernel and run it <br />
